    <h3>Kasol-Malana</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Malana is an ancient Indian village in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
    This solitary village in the Malana Nala, a side valley of the Parvati
    Valley to the north-east of Kullu Valley, is isolated from the rest of
    the world due to which it has an enriched beauty. The locals claim it
    to be one of the oldest democracies of the world with a well-organized
    parliamentary system, guided by their devta. It is around 21kms from
    Kasol and your trekking trail takes you through some of the majestic
    scenes of the region. The Village is guarded by towering peaks and is
    certainly not easy to climb. Malana is an unusual village guarded by
    the pines; away from the mainstream. The silvery moon and the
    twinkling stars bedeck the sky, the snow-capped mountains, and the
    rising and setting sun are in itself an unforgettable glory. To
    experience snowfall you can trek to Malana from Mid â€“ December to
    February first week.
