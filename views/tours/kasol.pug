        | Malana is an ancient Indian village in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This solitary village in the Malana Nala, a side valley of the Parvati Valley to the north-east of Kullu Valley, is isolated from the rest of the world due to which it has an enriched beauty. The locals claim it to be one of the oldest democracies of the world with a well-organized parliamentary system, guided by their devta. It is around 21kms from Kasol and your trekking trail takes you through some of the majestic scenes of the region. The Village is guarded by towering peaks and is certainly not easy to climb. Malana is an unusual village guarded by the pines; away from the mainstream. The silvery moon and the twinkling stars bedeck the sky, the snow-capped mountains, and the rising and setting sun are in itself an unforgettable glory. To experience snowfall you can trek to Malana from Mid &ndash; December to February first week.
